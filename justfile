# Build the runtime image, stamping the current commit as an OCI label.
# Passed explicitly rather than left to BuildKit's own VCS capture, which needs
# a working client-side git and silently yields nothing when it does not have
# one — under `sudo` (git refuses a repo it does not own), or in a CI checkout
# with no .git. A label is also inspectable with `docker inspect`, unlike a
# provenance attestation.
#
# The fallback matters: without it, `sudo just docker-build` runs git as root,
# git refuses the repo, and GIT_SHA becomes an empty string — an empty label
# that looks like a real value. "unknown" is at least honest.

# `just agentcfg check` is what someone runs after editing their profile, and the
# point is that it needs nothing installed: the published binary is static, and
# the Go repositories have no Rust toolchain to build one with. The version
# comes from `.agentprofile.yml`, so the cache cannot drift from the pin — a
# bump fetches a new file rather than reusing a stale one — and `.agentcfg/` is
# gitignored, so nothing downloaded is ever committed.
